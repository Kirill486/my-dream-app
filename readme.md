# ToDoManage

Something more then just another toDo app

## Description

The idea was that we can make the project of the application and then write it using the language or framework of choice. Like our buisiness logic is language and framework agnostic.

So, I decided to write the front-end application from the scratch starting with the project.

## Installation and Run

Firstly, you need NodeJs to be installed on your computer.

try type `node --version` in your console.

[Get NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

To run project you need TypeScript installed globally

```
npm install -g typescript@next
```

To build project run

```
./application/build.sh
```

Open application with your browser

```
./application/dist/index.html
```

## Separation of concerns

Lets assume our app is a set of conserns. (Like in separation of concerns principle).

So, lets name them:
* store data,
* represent data
* store data between sessions
...

Our conserns made of API and implementation.
So, we define ancestors to make an API manifest.

We have one **major** consern. It is **Buisiness Logic**.
It is the only place we have different concerns in one place.

Our buisiness logic consists of 

1. **Use Cases** and **Controllers** - the logic part.
2. **View Pool** and **ViewControllers** - the map to view-model part.
3. **Buisiness repository** - the adapter from state to repository.
4. **Buisiness logger** - the adapter from logging to repository.

So, looks like for each peice of functionality we have a **consern** itself (API and implementation like view, model, repository) 
and a **buisiness mapping** from our application need to conserns API.

## Version history

v 1.0.0 - we have functioning ToDoApplication
v 1.1.0 - styling
v 1.2.0 - between sessions data storage

v 2.0.0

1. Critical bug fixes 
2. Styling improvements, animation
3. Since this version we'll be rewriting parts of the application using 3rd party libraries ðŸŽ‰.

## Feature Pool

* style the application - **V**
* store data between sessions - **V**
* request confirmation when leave the toDoDetails with unsaved data
* do not render toDoDetails when no toDo selected - **V**
* click outside unselects toDo
* move save data logic to a exit application sequence

## Extention with 3rd party libraries.

So, the idea was that there's no difference what libraries you use, the buisiness logic stay the same.

### React ecosystem

The `development__react` branch.
We'll integrate parts of usual react ecosystem
in separate branches and then we make one react-master branch that
will be target for our pull requests.

* React (replaces View)
* redux (replaces Model)
* react-redux (replaces viewControllers and ViewPool)
* redux-saga (replaces UseCases)

### Angular 2+ ecosystem

* rewrite the application using the Angular 8+
