# React ecosystem

## Intro

We replace the application concerns (model, view, buisiness_logic) one by one with react ecosystem modules.

## Step-by-step plan

1. Build
2. Branch for each React ecosystem component
3. TargetBranch

## Map application concerns to React ecosystem modules.

So, the 3rd party libraries will replace what we initially implemented.

react - view

react - redux - viewController

redux - model

redux-saga - buisiness_logic
